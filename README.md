# Radix Chat

Welcome to Radix Chat, the chat app that almost was the new era of social media. If you’ve ever dreamed of a global chat experience where you can debate hot topics of the day, vote on future discussions, and maybe even chat privately with friends, you’ve come to the right place. Or, rather, you would have if this project had ever been finished. Think of it as a prototype in the museum of code, a digital fossil in the landscape of programming.

## 🌐 What is Radix Chat?

Radix Chat aimed to be the ultimate platform for global discussions. Picture a place where you could:

- **Engage in Global Conversations**: Discuss a daily-changing topic with people from around the world. (Assuming it wouldn't have thousands of bugs.)
- **Vote on Topics**: Propose and vote on new discussion topics for the next day. Democracy meets chat in a way that might have worked... eventually.
- **Private Messaging**: Think of it as your private chat space, like Discord or WhatsApp, but with fewer bugs and more features (if we ever got around to it).
    
## 🚀 Features

- **Global Chatroom**: Discuss on the so called "Topic of the day".
- **Daily Changing Topics**: Stay engaged with fresh discussions every day.
- **Topic Voting System**: Have a say in what’s discussed the next day.
- **Private Chats**: Create private conversations with friends. (Or just imagine them, since they’re not quite here yet.)

## 🚧 Current Status

- **Unfinished**: If you’re looking for a complete chat experience, you might want to keep looking.
- **Buggy**: We prefer to call them "features in progress."
- **Experimental**: Consider this project a sandbox for what could have been.

## 🛠️ Getting It to Run

Setting up the backend is a breeze! For instructions on getting the backend up and running, check out the backend/README.md file. 
As for the frontend, well, let’s just say it’s a bit of a wild card. Good luck getting the C code by [@nosehad](https://github.com/nosehad) to work — consider it a fun (or not so fun) challenge!

## 🤔 Known Issues

- **Broken Features**: Nearly everything.
- **Incomplete UI**: Our UI designer was on vacation — forever.
- **Outdated Documentation**: Because why document something that’s not functional?
